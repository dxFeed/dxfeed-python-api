Custom Event Handler
====================
Here we will look into custom event handler implementation. Unlike the
Basic Usage example, we will not pay much attention to anything behind
the handler.

Handler is a special object inherited from dxfeed.EventHandler class. It
is attached to the Subscription. When an event comes, internal
structures call the update method of your handler with event as a
parameter. event is a list with data specific to each event type. For
example, for the Trade event type: ‘Symbol’, ‘Price’, ‘ExchangeCode’,
‘Size’, ‘Tick’, ‘Change’, ‘DayVolume’, ‘Time’, ‘IsETH’. More info here:
https://kb.dxfeed.com/display/DS/dxFeed+API+Market+Events

After adding symbols or attaching a default listener (what is actually
done implicitly in the first case) list of one-word descriptions of
event data is stored in columns field of your handler object, attached
to Subscription.

In this example, we will implement the event handler that prints price
and volume changes for candle ask events. It also prints average volume
change for the last 10 ask events.

Import package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python3

    import dxfeed as dx
    from dxfeed.core.utils.data_class import DequeWithLock # custom deque with thread lock
    from datetime import datetime  # for timed subscription
    from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
    import numpy as np

Configure and create connection with Endpoint class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create instance of Endpoint class which will connect provided address.

.. code:: python3

    endpoint = dx.Endpoint('demo.dxfeed.com:7300')

Configure and create subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should specify event type. For timed subscription (conflated stream)
you should also provide time to start subscription from.

.. code:: python3

    candle_sub = endpoint.create_subscription('Candle', date_time=datetime.now() - relativedelta(days=3))

.. code:: ipython3

    class DiffHandler(dx.EventHandler):
        def __init__(self):
            self.__prev_open = None
            self.__prev_high = None
            self.__prev_low = None
            self.__prev_close = None
            self.__prev_volume = None
            self.volume_changes = DequeWithLock()
            self.counter = 0

        def update(self, events):
            for event in events:
                if not np.isnan(event.ask_volume):  # AskVolume not nan
                    self.counter += 1
                    print(f'Symbol: {event.symbol}')
                    if self.counter == 1:
                        self.__prev_open = event.open
                        self.__prev_high = event.high
                        self.__prev_low = event.low
                        self.__prev_close = event.close
                        self.__prev_volume = event.ask_volume
                        print('First event processed')
                        print('-------------------')
                    else:
                        print(f'Open changed by: {event.open - self.__prev_open}')
                        self.__prev_open = event.open
                        print(f'High changed by: {event.high - self.__prev_high}')
                        self.__prev_high = event.high
                        print(f'Open changed by: {event.low - self.__prev_low}')
                        self.__prev_low = event.low
                        print(f'Close changed by: {event.close - self.__prev_close}')
                        self.__prev_close = event.close
                        # Volume logic
                        vol_change = event.ask_volume - self.__prev_volume
                        self.volume_changes.safe_append(vol_change)
                        print(f'Volume changed by: {vol_change}, from {self.__prev_volume}, to {event.ask_volume}')
                        self.__prev_volume = event.ask_volume
                        print(f'Ask events prcessed: {self.counter}')
                        print('-------------------')
                        if self.counter % 10 == 0:
                            print(f'Average volume change for 10 past ask events is: {sum(self.volume_changes) / len(self.volume_changes)}')
                            self.volume_changes.clear()
                            print('-------------------')

For Candle event type along with base symbol, you should specify an
aggregation period. You can also set price type. More details:

.. code:: python3

    handler = DiffHandler()
    candle_sub.set_event_handler(handler).add_symbols(['AAPL{=d}']);
